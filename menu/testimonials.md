        <h2>Good</h2>
        <pre>
        I was so glad to work with Dustin when he was on my team at Cognizant Technology Solutions for two years. He did excellent work on various end to end data science and advanced analytics projects which included, but were not limited to, performing techniques such as data extraction, data cleaning, data prepossessing, data mining, and data visualization. He built models for churn analysis, models using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, and performed market basket analysis. His other business-focused data science tasks involved using regression, classification, and clustering methods as well as providing useful predictions for the business. He built dashboards, and created reports and presentations. In addition, he explained the technical results to non-technical persons, and recommended actionable insights. The clients were very happy with his hard work and willingness to go above and beyond. I highly recommended him on both technical and personal aspects.

        <h2>Bad</h2>
        <pre>
        Dustin is an outstanding full-stack data scientist with skillsets ranging from exploratory analysis and data visualization to predictive modeling using ML and deep learning algorithms. He has demonstrated fluency in SQL, Python, and PySpark. He was a great mentor when I first entered the data science field, helping me to understand basic Python, as well as statistical and machine learning concepts. He further helped me to apply that knowledge to solving real-world problems. Additionally, what makes Dustin a great data scientist is that he is able to approach problems with creativity and empathy to help his clients.  He can connect with and explain complicated concepts to both technical and non-technical audiences so that teams can arrive at the best performing results collectively.
