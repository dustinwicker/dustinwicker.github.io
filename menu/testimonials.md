title: Testimonials from Former Colleagues and Mentees

I was so glad to work with Dustin when he was on my team at Cognizant Technology Solutions for two years. He did excellent work on various end to end data science and advanced analytics projects which included, but were not limited to, performing techniques such as data extraction, data cleaning, data prepossessing, data mining, and data visualization. He built models for churn analysis, models using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, and performed market basket analysis. His other business-focused data science tasks involved using regression, classification, and clustering methods as well as providing useful predictions for the business. He built dashboards, and created reports and presentations. In addition, he explained the technical results to non-technical persons, and recommended actionable insights. The clients were very happy with his hard work and willingness to go above and beyond. I highly recommended him on both technical and personal aspects.

Dustin is an outstanding full-stack data scientist with skillsets ranging from exploratory analysis and data visualization to predictive modeling using ML and deep learning algorithms. He has demonstrated fluency in SQL, Python, and PySpark. He was a great mentor when I first entered the data science field, helping me to understand basic Python, as well as statistical and machine learning concepts. He further helped me to apply that knowledge to solving real-world problems. Additionally, what makes Dustin a great data scientist is that he is able to approach problems with creativity and empathy to help his clients.  He can connect with and explain complicated concepts to both technical and non-technical audiences so that teams can arrive at the best performing results collectively.

Dustin was my mentor for over half a year as I went through training to become a Data Scientist. His support and encouragement during that time were instrumental to my success. During our time together, I felt confident taking technical risks and tackling unconventional projects, because I knew that if I ever got stuck (and I did - several times) he would help me understand the problem from every relevant angle, and then solve it independently. He spares no effort in this process, explaining clearly, sharing resources, and sketching out ideas. Dustin is an expert in his field and a stellar teacher.

Dustin's talent as a teacher doesn't stop at the ability to explain complex ideas, however. He is patient, empathetic, and personable. I knew I could count on him to resolve my doubts regardless of their number or nature. Under his guidance, I internalized Python syntax, learned how to make data tell a story, and operationalized machine learning models that solved real-world problems. Whenever I wanted to explore projects that weren't covered by the syllabus, he would feed my curiosity. I built dashboards, worked with the Twitter API, and trained deep learning models to recognize hand gestures and play songs. Dustin not only made my efforts to learn more fruitful but made them infinitely more enjoyable as well.

Dustin and I were working together when the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020. Throughout that experience, Dustin was as supportive and as cheerful as ever, and I found myself looking forward to the ritual of meeting him twice a week, if only virtually. I am very grateful to have had the chance to learn from him for the better part of a year, and he has my most sincere recommendation.

Feel free to message me through my LinkedIn profile if you have any questions.
