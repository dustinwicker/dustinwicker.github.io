I was so glad to work with Dustin when he was on my team at Cognizant Technology Solutions for two years. He did excellent work on various end to end data science and advanced analytics projects which included, but were not limited to, performing techniques such as data extraction, data cleaning, data prepossessing, data mining, and data visualization. He built models for churn analysis, models using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, and performed market basket analysis. His other business-focused data science tasks involved using regression, classification, and clustering methods as well as providing useful predictions for the business. He built dashboards, and created reports and presentations. In addition, he explained the technical results to non-technical persons, and recommended actionable insights. The clients were very happy with his hard work and willingness to go above and beyond. I highly recommended him on both technical and personal aspects.

Dustin was my mentor for over half a year as I went through training to become a Data Scientist. His support and encouragement during that time were instrumental to my success. During our time together, I felt confident taking technical risks and tackling unconventional projects, because I knew that if I ever got stuck (and I did - several times) he would help me understand the problem from every relevant angle, and then solve it independently. He spares no effort in this process, explaining clearly, sharing resources, and sketching out ideas. Dustin is an expert in his field and a stellar teacher.

Dustin's talent as a teacher doesn't stop at the ability to explain complex ideas, however. He is patient, empathetic, and personable. I knew I could count on him to resolve my doubts regardless of their number or nature. Under his guidance, I internalized Python syntax, learned how to make data tell a story, and operationalized machine learning models that solved real-world problems. Whenever I wanted to explore projects that weren't covered by the syllabus, he would feed my curiosity. I built dashboards, worked with the Twitter API, and trained deep learning models to recognize hand gestures and play songs. Dustin not only made my efforts to learn more fruitful but made them infinitely more enjoyable as well.

Dustin and I were working together when the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020. Throughout that experience, Dustin was as supportive and as cheerful as ever, and I found myself looking forward to the ritual of meeting him twice a week, if only virtually. I am very grateful to have had the chance to learn from him for the better part of a year, and he has my most sincere recommendation.

Feel free to message me through my LinkedIn profile if you have any questions.

Investing in a bootcamp is often a tough choice for someone looking to make a career change. The insecurity for me was mainly centered on whether I would gain anything additionally from going through a bootcamp versus learning the material on my own. I started the bootcamp in mid-2020 and began working with Dustin as my mentor. His Python expertise and project advice made all the difference. Throughout each mentoring session, Dustin was patient in explaining concepts and was always eager to help. It was not out of the norm for our meetings to run a bit over time. However, he was always more concerned with me leaving with all my questions answered versus the additional time spent. Whether I was asking about statistical tests, model assumptions, PCA, machine learning algorithms, SQL, or general Python code, I was impressed by his wealth of information and his ability to convey it in an understandable manner. Dustin took the time to understand each of my project ideas and was able to make valuable suggestions to improve them. I completed the Thinkful Data Science program in November 2020. Looking back, I can state that the real value of my Thinkful experience was in the bi-weekly meeting with Dustin. I am appreciative of Dustin for helping me get to the finish line and recommend him for all things Data Science.

Throughout my seven months as a student in Thinkful’s data science program, I had the pleasure of having Dustin Wicker serve as my mentor. Dustin possesses all of the characteristics one could hope for in a teacher. He was excellent at breaking down complex concepts and explaining them in a manner that I was able to understand. He was always patient, cheerful, and personable. Above all else, he was exceptionally knowledgeable in the field of data science.

Together Dustin and I worked on pulling and analyzing data using SQL, ingesting the data into Python, performing exploratory data analysis, and building machine learning and deep learning models. From getting a handle on the basics of Python and SQL at the start of the program, to understanding far more complex branches of data science involving API’s, web scraping, and big data, Dustin was always able to offer guidance, and assisted me tremendously throughout the program in learning these concepts.

While working through Thinkful’s data science curriculum, I created capstone projects involving both supervised and unsupervised learning models. Whenever I felt stuck, Dustin helped me progress through the projects, not by doing the work for me, but by offering the necessary encouragement and support to be able to find the answers for myself. I am indebted to Dustin for the help he provided throughout the program, and unequivocally give him my highest level of recommendation.
