I work as a Data Science Mentor for Thinkful where I engage with students in a one-on-one setting, and lead them through a curriculum specializing in Python, SQL, and Spark. Throughout their time with me, we work together to develop their analytical skills by going through modules containing topics such as:
* Data Cleaning
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Data Visualizations
* Statistics
* Experimental Design
* A/B Testing
* Supervised Learning
* Unsupervised Learning
* Machine Learning
* Deep Learning
* Time Series 
* Natural Language Processing
* Big Data
* Web Scraping and APIs  

Along the way, I help them to assimilate professional development and interview skills, build their personal portfolio, and offer resume writing tips.  
  
The opportunity to teach people the full data science stack is an absolute blessing. I am able to interact with a wonderful group of individuals while strengthening my understanding of key data science topics. However, I want to push myself to learn new things, stretch my abilities to gain more skills, and help others in a different way. Mentoring is certainly something I will do in some capacity for a long time as I love teaching others, but I am open to new job opportunities, whether they are the full-time or freelancing type.
* To contact me regarding job opportunities, feel free to reach out at any of the options **[here](https://dustinwicker.github.io/menu/contact.html)**.
* If you would like to view my resume, please follow this **[link](https://github.com/dustinwicker/Resume/blob/master/Resume%20-%20Dustin%20Wicker.pdf)** (you may need to scroll down a little to view the document).

As for this blog and portfolio, this space is meant to serve two purposes:  
* A platform where I can **[post](https://dustinwicker.github.io/menu/posts.html)** to explain projects I have created and worked on. These will demonstrate the full spectrum of data science skills I possess, with explanations, visualizations, and code detailing the steps I took to solve the task at hand.
   * This will allow perspective clients and job opportunities to see the analytical abilities I have, and give them an understanding of the work I can provide to them to solve their data-related challenges.
* A place the wonderful people I mentor, as well as others looking to gain knowledge about data science and analytics, can come and learn.  
   * These posts are intended to be **t**eaching **r**esources so to differentiate them from regular posts, they will be denoted with a (TR) at the end of the title.
   * These are meant to be concise write-ups that clearly explain the topic being explored alongside code that has been conscientiously commented so the reader can gain the understanding they need and are also able to execute the topic effectively in their code script.  
     * If there is a topic you would like to see explained that is not listed, please send me an [email](mailto:dustinlwicker@gmail.com "Click to send me an email"), and I will add it.
  
I truly hope you enjoy yourself while on my website and learn something!
