Welcome to my blog and portfolio! This space is meant to serve two purposes:  
* A platform where I can post to detail projects I have created and worked on. These will demonstrate the full spectrum of data science skills I possess, with explanations, visualizations, and code detailing the steps I took to solve the task at hand.
   * This will allow perspective clients to see the analytical abilities I have, and give them an understanding of the work I can provide to them to solve their data-related challenges.
* A place the wonderful people I mentor, as well as others looking to gain knowledge about data science and analytics, can come and learn.
