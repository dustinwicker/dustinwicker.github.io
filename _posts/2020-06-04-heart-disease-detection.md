## Project Summary  
Statistical analysis, data mining techniques, and five machine learning models (include the five models?) were built and ensembled to accurately predict the presence of heart disease in patients from the Hungarian Institute of Cardiology in Budapest. All told, the model which provided the optimal combination of total patients predicted correctly and F1 Score, while being the most parsimonious one, was the Support Vector Machine Classification Model #4 (bold important words.)

## Project Overview  
# [Data Ingestion and Data Cleaning]
# [Exploratory Data Analysis](#exploratory-data-analysis)
The first step was obtaining the [data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/heart-disease/hungarian.data) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.  
  
The Hungarian data was ingested into Python and data cleaning was performed. This involved:  
* Removing unnecessary columns
* Removing rows with a large percentage of missing values
* Imputing missing values for patients using K-Nearest Neighbors, an advanced data imputation method

Hi there! I'm Paul. Iâ€™m a physics major turned programmer. Ever since I first learned how to program while taking a scientific computing for physics course, I have pursued programming as a passion, and as a career. Check out [my personal website](https://www.lenpaul.com/) for more information on my other projects (including more Jekyll themes!), as well as some of my writing.
