This project details the process I took to build a model that is capable of predicting the presence of heart disease in patients as well as outlining ways to use it in order to combat the devastation caused by the disease.  
  
 Please leave a comment at the bottom of the page to let me know your thoughts on the project and the actions I took to arrive at the final model. At the end of the [Project Overview](#project-overview), there are questions posed for reflection and deliberation - feel free to answer one of those too if you would like.

## Project Summary  

Code snippets will be provided for each section outlined in the [Project Overview](#project-overview) at the bottom of the page. The snippets will encompass the entire script, broken into their related sections. If you would like to view the code script in its entirety, please visit this [link](https://github.com/dustinwicker/Heart-Disease-Detection/blob/master/heart_disease_code.py/?target=%22_blank%22).

## Model Visualization, Comparison, and Selection [<sub><sup>(View code)</sup></sub>](#model-visualization-comparison-and-selection)
* ROC Curves were built based on each model's predicted probabilities to visually compare model performance at various cut-off values.

## Questions for Consideration/Analysis Expansion in the Future
* Pull all teams season ending records and statistics (correlations between 60 game playoff teams and their final result and 60 game standings and playoff teams - their correlations) .54
